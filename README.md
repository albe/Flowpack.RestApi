## What is this

Flowpack.RestApi is a approach to simple Rest API build in Flow - totally separated from the rest of your application

## Installation

> This package is not on packagist at the moment of writing and is not a official Flowpack.

Add the following to `composer.json` in the `repositories` section

```
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/sorenmalling/Flowpack.RestApi"
        }
```

and require the `flowpack/rest-api` as such

```
"flowpack/rest-api": "dev-master"
```

You might have to adjust your `minimum-stability` and such.

## Implement into your own package

Create a Rest API package for your project and add controllers for endpoints similar to this **DEMO PACKAGE**
